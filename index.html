<p> This website is about sharing in the faith of Holy Spirit. We know that when God gave us his breath of life, it came with consciousness, a spirit, and a soul; 
	now we can elevate faith to the next level to learn how they work independently and dependently to define life force. Where spiritual 
	fulfillment elevates purpose for living and prepares for the inevitable; crossing over to the afterlife. Faith awakens the supernatural 
	desiring to be shared; sharing is of its very essence. We can all help each other by sharing; allowing holy mercy opportunities to bless beyond continually.  </p><p>  <br />

						<p>
					We are living soul which are breath of life and living light of Holy Spirit. For those who live in the spirit; 
					life is about learning the conditions of the soul to gain strength. As faith grows so does the awareness of 
					living light, though if faith is not grounded in righteousness; one’s perception can easily be controlled 
					by much that is not. For those who learn about faith learn about light and darkness, and for those who do 
					not are blinded by the both. Myself, I have become most familiar with the light of Holy Spirit which he 
					provides to all who yearn; unconditionally. I give glory to his light with every breath that I get because 
					all that contains me is of his own. And because of where my faith has taken me; I believe in his living light above all.
					</p>
					<p>
					The living light of Holy Spirit is the most powerful natural and supernatural light, that is, and his light shines 
					his love for all who desire his affection. He is the source of where from all love and light originates. What one 
					believes to be true concerning his light is truth for self through faith when hope does not doubt. My observation 
					of his light is awe surpassing light that can be seen and felt through the faith of all that is of his own. His living 
					light is the very essence of the living soul which is given to all to learn from. His light must be recognized and 
					understood before attempting to recognize and understand the light that is of self. Yes, everyone has their own light 
					of soul to learn to get to know. Only through faith can one be taught of all that their light consists of. Once one 
					begins to live for his purpose's awareness begins and grows for his truths. It’s all about learning the strength of 
					faith and once awareness grows the invisible living light starts to become visible; this is what living in Holy Spirit 
					reveals. All who have ever welcomed his light become enlightened because he is the greatest reality and the most powerful 
					bond with living soul.
					</p>
					<p>
					Our world received his Holiest Light as a testimony to his mercy so that all of creation will be held accountable for 
					his incarnation. As Christians, we received our salvation from and for his glory. His light radiates through all that 
					is of existence of the corporeal and the supernatural. Through faith of his ascension, the two are no longer separate; 
					they become one. His light touches all that is of creation which is continually blessing; just as mercy and love of his own always does.
					</p>
					<p>
					Most are unaware there are supernatural lights that exist amongst us that are just as actual as what we understand to be 
					of reality. Once anyone takes spirituality seriously, they soon become observant of this truth. Though be aware and beware 
					this initial awareness is when most get deceived into believing a grand form of supernatural light that is not of holiness. 
					Question all supernatural light by the truth of Holy Scripture and one will not be misleading. Of all of which I have become 
					most familiar with; Holy Spirit influences entirely. This is where my faith reaches, and this is where my faith thrives. My faith 
					defines all of who that I have become and my faith defies limitations for growth.       
					</p>                  
					<p>
					Sometimes other supernatural light beside your own may be revealed for many different reasons. When this happens, do not doubt 
					what you are seeing, because if you do it will instantly dissipate. And it will not come back again until you have learned not 
					to question or doubt the unfathomable and the unimaginable concerning spiritual truths, and to learn more about not ever doubting 
					faith. These supernatural lights can illuminate anywhere at any time directly from their own visible or invisible source. Until one 
					learns to recognize how faith and light coexist will one be able to look into the light and communicate with its all.  
					</p>   
					<p>
					When one is blessed by Holy Spirit he gives the gift of discernment for all spirits and supernatural light. At this point in faith, 
					doubt doesn't exist anymore; only overwhelming trust that lives for his most awesome truths. Know that every supernatural light has 
					a spirit of its own that can be felt. Once one learns to feel and be aware of spirits is when recognition of different spirits of 
					light occurs. Know the first intuition that one feels of any light is always correct; this is Holy Spirit communicating with one’s 
					self. If it is questionable, then it most likely is opposing. If one goes against their intuition, they most likely will end up being 
					deceived. Know that supernatural light exists in all that is of creation, though only through spiritual eyes that do not doubt can it 
					be seen. Know that even all that is of darkness has a supernatural light that belongs to its own. Light does exist in darkness, though 
					darkness cannot exist in light. Though most important to understand is there is supernatural light that consists of spirit of darkness 
					that is not the light of Holy Spirit. If a Christian does not question each spirit of light, or if one is not strong enough through the 
					faith of Holy Spirit they will be deceived by a brilliant light that is not holy without knowing they are blindly being misled. 
					</p>
					<p>
					Do not over think this. These are very simple easy truths to understand. Do not be overly alarmed because where your faith and your 
					will are being; are of all that your self-spirit possesses. And your self-spirit is what attracts or repels different varieties of 
					supernatural light. Whatever values one possesses is connected through spirit with what kind of light is attracted to one's own. As a 
					Christian do not ponder or worry about these issues because your faith has given you the strength to prevail. Your spirit is of an 
					essence of righteousness which blesses the light of soul to illuminate and transform into one with holiness. Ask the Lord to teach you 
					everything concerning the supernatural and spiritual light that you need to know, and he will.
					</p>
					<p>
					The living light that lives inside of you is your living soul. This is your gift of life that is meant for all to learn to get to know. 
					This living light will teach you everything that you need to understand concerning this spiritual world and prepare you for the next 
					where your soul will eventually go. Without a doubt, you are from the heavens above; you are a direct descendant of his most awesome 
					love. Now that you are becoming aware of his simplest of truths; bless them for spiritual growth. The light that you possess blesses 
					all that it touches. And as it blesses; it also gets blessed in return. Your living light will always be joined with Holy Spirit to 
					bless and be blessed by his all. 
					</p>
					<p>
					To bless the light that lives inside of one's soul continues with undoubting faith and honest condition of self-spirit. These unions 
					open awareness to perceive of their unique and awesome content. To fully understand the definition of self-spirit is to control every 
					thought and desire that one possesses which have spiritual energy all to their own. Whether of negative or positive energy is what 
					determines the condition of self-spirit and the light of Holy Spirit that wants to thrive within. Negative and positive energy cannot 
					grow together. They are always in conflict, thus depriving consciousness, spirit, and soul of spiritual growth for awareness of their 
					truths. Once one gets their thoughts in check with holiness; the blessings begin to transform one’s entire being. Then the living light 
					that lives inside of one’s self will be revealed and begin to communicate and teach about growth. The light of self-has much that it 
					wants to share. Only through growth can we learn to recognize the mysteries of life; for consciousness and spirit, and soul to grow 
					together in faith to reach prosperity.           
					</p>
					<p>
					Understand, along the path of spiritual growth one must learn about weaknesses and strengths. All must face the questionable and 
					opposing to get stronger. All must learn from their mistakes. When this happens, never give up no matter what? Pray for strength 
					and with patience, you will be given the answers to persevere and prevail. After all of the pain that I caused myself, I finally 
					understand that my purpose for life is about learning the truths of the Living Light of Holy Spirit for becoming one with all that 
					is of his own.
					</p>
					<p>
					Your living light is alive. Your gift of soul is eternal, and it yearns so very desperate for you to learn of its truths. Time is 
					of the essence to learn as much as you can. If one learns too late, than how much of its blessings can be given and shared? Or if 
					one never learns of the truths of living soul, what does that mean when one has to leave this world? Please, do not jeopardize your 
					spiritual future. There are many lessons for each to learn about while they are living their appointed time in this world. Do not 
					let time pass you by, become a part of your spiritual destiny now and you will be blessed.          
					</p>                 
					<p>
					The awareness of light of soul has changed my entire life. It has given me an undeniable yearning to find all of the spiritual 
					truths that I can. There is so much more I want to learn to be able to spiritually grow now that I have been given a glimpse. 
					I want my Holy Lord to be pleased with me concerning my will to serve him with all of my strength. The awareness of soul has changed 
					me into a devoted spiritual man; I search for the truth within all. And because of my awakening, it has blessed me with much that 
					I am just beginning to learn to understand. It doesn’t matter where I go from here, nothing will detour my devotion; I have surrendered 
					my life and soul to always be one in Christ. His Living Light has so much that it wants to share and I praise my Lord with the deepest of 
					love that I pray will eternally grow.           
					</p>
					<p>
					“Everlasting Light, you have changed my life, and I thank you for restoring my soul. Thank you for setting my spirit free. Thank you for 
					rescuing and saving me. With tears of love; I always want to be a part of all that is your own. I love you my Holy Lord so very much and 
					I pray that I never get separated from you again. I am so very grateful for your love; it has made me very strong. You are everything to 
					me and you are all that I am living for. Your light is brighter than the sun. In fact, if every star that exists in all of creation were 
					to join power and light; theirs would be just a spark compared to your own. 
					<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the world does crumble beneath my feet, without a doubt, when it all comes as sure as it will. It 
					will not shake me, I won’t tremble, I won’t stumble and I won’t fall. I will be standing strong giving praise and giving glory to your all. 
					My reason for living is to live in your will, and I thank you, my Lord, for your gift of life. Your love penetrates and consumes my entire 
					being. You are all that I ever needed to make my life complete, and I shout it out into the heavens and into the stars for all of creation 
					to know that I will always be your humble and beloved.   
					
					And I pray that I will always have your Holy Light inside of my soul. I love you my Holy Father, Christ Jesus, and Holy Spirit”.
