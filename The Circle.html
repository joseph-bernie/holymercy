              This book is about the supernatural and the spiritual that my faith has learned from. I have learned not to define their possibilities; they thrive to be 
              free to evolve and transform. Everyone has their own faiths they are destined to learn from; this book is to share what is of my own.  </p> 
                                <p>	
                We all live together in one world called Earth, though we each live in our own separate spiritual worlds with or without knowledge of this fact of life. 
                All that is of the spiritual shares through invisible likewise force; depending on the condition of the spirit of self. And always incomprehensible; 
                until spiritual awareness learns. All that is about the spiritual and supernatural is of infinite possibilities and each for their own that each consists 
                of. The supernatural is difficult to explain, though easily perceived depending on individual spiritual truths. Each has their own answers to find, and 
                all will be revealed while seeking for spiritual truths. 
                                </p> 
                                <p> 
                This book is about my faith. For myself, I put all of my faith and love in Holy Spirit; Whose very presence creates inner peace within me and blesses 
                everything in my life; without question of his majesty. Since the beginning of time, free will has been given to all to do with as one chooses, which 
                has evolved and expanded into many spiritual dimensions and extremes. And from this freedom, it is my destiny to learn of the truths, and why? I have 
                learned that in the spiritual everything has a reason. And as I live my life; I learn of all of which are my own. And of all where my faith reaches 
                come together for the same cause as spiritual awareness grows.      
                                </p>
                              
                  
                          
                        <h1>Introduction</h1>
                
                            
                              <br />
                          <br />

                          <p>
                This book was written to be shared with all who live in spirit by faith. I have learned that for every spiritual fact that there are countless answers. 
                All that exists of spiritual awareness is a part of one big elaborate plan for many different reasons, and many different definitions for why? All is 
                connected with likewise spirit and love to fulfill destiny. You alone decide your own state of mind, you alone decide what spirits will be closest and 
                farthest to your own, and you alone decide the destiny of your own soul by the way that you live your life. All that is of the corporeal is of the 
                spiritual; which is where all first originated from. It all comes together just as it always has been since the beginning of time. Which brings us to 
                our own moment of time to do as one chooses; for me to explore the many spiritual reasons why?
                            </p>  
                              <p>
                All that exists within the entire spiritual and supernatural; we each do live within every day in our world and every day in our lives. We touch it, and 
                it touches our spirit and our mind; it cannot be denied. We are our own spirits being influenced by all that our spirit touches. In the light and in the 
                darkness, there are many spiritual realms which are a part of our own home here on Earth that are of corporeal and spiritual dimensions all to their own, 
                and is of where many living spirits and living souls call their own home. They are not ghosts; all consist of incomprehensible spiritual material matter 
                mixed with supernatural truths.
                              </p>     
                            <p>
                For me, and for everyone does influence the world and the realms that we each do live within by all that our own self spirit is aware of. This is a 
                blessing once one learns of the truths. One does possess the strength to overcome all questionable force to choose all that matters the most for self. 
                For us, this is only just the beginning of the everlasting, for there are many facts about spirituality that we will learn to comprehend as union with 
                Holy Spirit grows. Only through faith that does not doubt can it make any sense.</p>
                              <p>
                I wrote this book to inspire, and to encourage. Hold on to your faith, and all that you are living for, because it is all slowly coming true. 
                              </p>

                  <p>
              This book brings insight that life is full of many choices. And each is directly related and connected to all that is of each one’s own spiritual life; 
              life is a journey to learn how your own choices affect the consequences in your life. All of which determines our own spiritual path with new destinies 
              from which to learn of next. For each of us, these paths are different and lead to many different lessons to continue to advance. For there is much spirit 
              from which to learn that you have never known that is waiting to be found? For we are all born for many different purposes, and ultimately you will get to 
              where your spirit and soul desire to belong. Choose your own destiny with much discernment; set your course and never look back. Know that you are moving 
              your spiritual self, closer towards your highest of all goals. 
                      </p>
                    <p>
              No two lessons will ever be the same for anyone; and so is such for each one's own definition of spirituality. No two qualities or quantities of faith or 
              purposes for living ever are the same. Spiritual prosperity is to find out for self what it truly does all mean? My spiritual journey has led me to find 
              these many truths. Fueled from a yearning that comes from my soul and of all that I have grown to become. What I am meant to be, and of all that I want to 
              be that spiritual growth will allow. To find out these answers; I adhere to the love of Holy Spirit. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
              There are also other faiths, other truths, and other loves which are not a part of one's own; which are of others. And all of these spirits also exist 
              within the supernatural of different dimensions, just like that of which is of one's own; within and without each one’s own touch, depending on the state 
              of spirit. Everyone makes their own choices of who, and of what to believe in. Choose well with much discernment, for all does affect the unknown. Just 
              keep yourself protected by faith from anything that may be opposing or questions the truth that you hold. For myself; I find all comfort in Christ.
                      </p>
                  
                      <p> 
              All who hear these words who live by faith in spirit know this corporeal life are but a glimpse into much higher truths. With death only comes a 
              transformation of body, of spirit and of the soul. It is a new beginning, not an end; into dimensions that are incomprehensible, though very much 
              anticipated through Christ. We cannot even begin to comprehend what lies on the other side. So, prepare yourself for all that lies ahead.              
                      </p>  
                      <p>
              For now, of this world, and spirit of self; the only connection that matters is to connect with the everlasting of Holy Spirit. Which automatically takes 
              one even closer towards his ultimate truths. The more that spiritual awareness grows, the closer towards the heavens we each get within spirit; to where 
              the spirit soars, and to where the more there is to learn about and is where all of the answers began to make sense. This is just one fact of spiritual life; 
              meant for all who desire to share. Some soar, some run, some walk to get their spiritual desires fulfilled, and some never learn that there such a journey at 
              all. Though all will eventually learn about the supernatural; either now by faith, or later by the lack of. It is the never-ending journey of life for 
              everyone to learn about. And each to their own whatever they choose to do with the gift of life, and to where ever they may or may not want to go.
                      </p> 
                      <p>
              In this book, I emphasize awareness of all that one's spirit touches. Spirits are always active; with or without own knowledge of this fact. One's choices 
              determine the types of spirits and forces which influence corporeal and spiritual self; one's own freedom of choice determines what spiritual realms will 
              become a part of one's own.
                      </p> 
                      <p>
                I am an advocate of Christ who lives for his majesty. My judgment is constant which keeps me closest to his all. Salvation is a gift to all who chooses his 
                love. Know that all of the doors that are to the heavens are all waiting to be opened by one's self. I want to clarify that although these words concern 
                the supernatural that they have no association with any cult or occult. My own definition of faith, hope and love are of Holy Spirit.
                      </p>

<!--We live in a terrestrial world, which is also celestial. All that is capable of being seen is only a glimpse of a much greater truth. Between Earth and Heaven, there are many heavenly realms that exist where many life forms live. They are not spirits of the dead; they are real people just like us and also consist of mass and matter similar to our own, though with different qualities of supernatural realities of different dimensions. It varies in each realm, though the closer to Heaven the more overwhelmingly awesome it becomes. As in this world there are routes to get to various locations; such is the same between all heavenly realms. There are routes, or doors, or portals that connect each and every domain. And the keys that open the passageways come from spiritual strength from within. Faith and love are two of the most strongest keys to possess within the heavens that I am most familiar with. -->

<p>&nbsp;The life of a soldier isn’t always easy though it does have its benefits. Once one learns the truth about light; its supernatural become their only reality. 
  A soldier relies on their armor of God entirety; which is the very essence of the light of Christ. To learn about its strengths is to learn about freedoms and peace. 
  A soldier only fights when needed to defend and always wins. Though always knows that maybe eventually, their time will come to graciously lie down their life, for 
  they know that their sacrifice is not in vain. For they know that their living soul is everlasting and that they will fight again; knowing that even in the beyond 
  the battles don’t end within the heavenly for control and dominance of authority. A soldier knows their calling, and every call is another opportunity to glorify 
  their Holy Lord with all of their strength. A soldier knows where the battle lines are drawn and never questions or doubts about the reasons why.

With Holy Spirit inside of me, I am blessed to live in a love that belongs to his all. I am in him, and he is in me. Into the heavens, my spirit rises; he lifts me up 
to learn of his rewards. And every time there is a new awakening from which to learn. The passion of my spirit intensifies; the more elevation within his touch reaches. 
They fuel each other pleading with each other for more of his all. It is only because of his love that gives me a reason to live. There is so very much for me to learn 
to get strong enough to serve my Holy Lord the way that I want to do; like I know that I must do. He alone is why I strive for strength to grow, with an unquenchable 
yearning that will only be satisfied when I stand before his Almighty Throne glorifying him in unison with all who are of his own.  <br>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is fascinated with angels; the most intriguing fact 
  is that they are real. There are heavenly angels from heavenly realms who can come and go within our world. Our world exists somewhere within proximity of their own 
  higher dimensions.  They know how to come and go between the realities. Angels perform different duties for reasons of intervention. They are able to manipulate the 
  natural and the supernatural to complete their tasks. They mostly go unnoticed, though sometimes they are perceived. Most all of the time they don’t want to be seen, 
  which they have total control over, though sometimes, on rare occasions for various reasons they reveal themselves to encourage faith.    <br>

<p><!--In the supernatural, there are infinite varieties of light. Light is unique and extraordinary; just as hope, faith, and love are. They are the strongest of all powers, and each has its own capabilities. As with a hope, a faith, and a love; a light also exists somewhere within all possible extremes. God is the almighty light at the highest extreme, and at the other end of the extreme is a spark. Somewhere within this spectrum of extremes is where all supernatural light exists; including the light of self.-->  <br>

Unconditional love is the most powerful of all powers. It is one of the main ingredients of the soul and one of the most important reasons for life. To learn to 
recognize its presence is to know it is very much alive and knows who possesses of its same. Its spirit exists of holiness and acknowledges others with qualities 
like its own. Once it is recognized, it desires to share of it all; creating new blessings and strengths. Understanding the forces of unconditional love leads to 
understanding every mystery of the soul, the heavens, and God. Unconditional love intensifies with trusting faith. Ask for the strength that is needed, and it will be 
given, and the blessings continuously flow within from above.

   when he was born, and all give glory to the Holy Son of God. He caused all authorities to tremble because of his ultimate power. His willing sacrifice was for 
   everyone. Only then did the veal that separated us from the Holy of Holies be lifted to welcome all in; a new era for The Great White Throne began. He has 
   dominion and power over all creation. He is the Firstborn Son; born of the divine word of Almighty God to forever rule over and above all. After he rose from the 
   dead, and before he ascended to Heaven; he said, “You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all 
   Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”.   <br>
